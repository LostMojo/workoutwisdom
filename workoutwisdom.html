<h1>Discord's Workout Wisdom</h1>

<h2>On Training to Sword Duel:</h2>

<p>Yup! Tell your friend to to focus on your brachialis via reverse curls and the rest will follow - you could add some specific grip training if you'd like but your forearms, wrist and grip are essentially the same. Don’t forget that you’re pulling all that fun twisty sword motion from your obliques as well and show them some love if you aren't already! </p>

<p>Your friend like me might be too cool to stand around all day for reverse curls though -</p>
<p>Here's my diy wrist roller instead!</p> 
<p>Dirt simple and amazing forearm tool - I use an extra db bar, but you can use a branch, some twine and whatever pin (a smaller branch?) to lock weights/a milk jug in with.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lOFG0U_rlY">Usage guide for above ^ </a>

<p>I really like this question, I remember henry cavill had a fun video about the foci he endured training for the witcher, more specifically swinging a sword around all day. You should look that up - might be some great info there! </p>


<h2>On Pushups:</h2>

<p>I'm seconding [redacted]'s tips about handles, increasing the range of motion is just going to make your push up better and control your negative. Other than that: </p>
<p>Retract and then depress your scapula, do the motion sitting up and note how your chest puffs up and out. Holding this cue will shift your movement to purely pec contraction as well as put your shoulders out of the way for safety. You want to minimize shoulder engagement in a push up, not chuck your entire weight at em.</p>


<h2>On Shoulder/Chest Balance:</h2>

<p>You're partly right, inbalances wreak all sorts of havoc on the body. The aptly called Note Dame syndrome is often attributed erronously to having weaker chest, but this comes from quick misunderstandings with little support. 
Stretching and releasing tight pecs is part of relaxing post-exercise, but they're not the major culprit. </p>
 
<p>The main issue stems from not dissecting the back into components and forgetting about the scapulars. While climbers typically have very strong lats, upper traps and erectors, the scapular stabilizers consisting of the rhomboids, low-mid traps, serratus anterior and deltoids (1) get little to no stimulaton and need supplemental training to stay healthy and pain-free. </p>
<p>You can see the difference in a free-hang in (2). While fully relaxed conserving energy , the upper back is no longer in a rigid position as it would be with stabilizers activated (3) </p>

<p>The overactive larger back muscles without the scapular support to "hold you back" eventually force the thoracic spine into a kyphosis position(4). </p>
<p>If you came to me with symptoms describing upper back pain or shoulder mobility trouble and you had this posture I would recommend you roll out your thoracic after heavy pulling work (5) and add a couple weekly sets of face pulls to strenghten the scapular muscles and rear deltoids. 10 minutes max a week, lots to gain!(edited)</p>

<p>So to sum up: Chest training is for everyone, but not that confusing if you know what you're going for. With some thought in your training plan you can pick what you're going to look like. </p>
<p>Extra care into upper chest training, making sure to include or prioritize on incline pressing, chest flye variations for a more masc look, and avoiding that best possible while still training your lower pecs heavily if you want to enhance the appearance of breasts. </p>

<p>Something you both will have in common is that you need to match your efficient chest training with equally efficient back training. </p>
<p>Matching your volume 1:1 is a good target to start with.</p>
<p>Otherwise your now strong chest will contort your body forwards, rolling your shoulders in and dropping your manly chest or perky bust into your body for nobody to see. While "rounded shoulders" is a common ailment, lifting gives you a free path out of it if you plan correctly</p>


<h2>On Splitting Your Workout:</h2>

<p>Splitting away into targeted training lets your add much more volume while adding minimal if any systematic fatigue. I'm all aboard!  </p>

<p>What split works for you will be largely dependent on your schedule and preference, with no real reason to stick to anything you don't love, try everything that sounds interesting. </p>

<p>I've tried about any split under the sun but in the end I always come back to some variation of push/pull/legs when in offseason, it best helps me dedicate volume evenly around all areas. In your example, instead of working back and arms, you'd more specifically work back and biceps - to then be able to switch to the antagonizers (chest and triceps, shoulders) without diminished performance directly after.(edited)</p>


<h2>On Home Workout Stuff:</h2>

<p>this is my cheap-at-home-essentials-gift-pricerange stuff! </p>
<p>i find loops infinitly more useful than bands, since you can do a lot of band stuff with loops, but little of loop stuff with bands.</p>

<p>This covers the stuff i HATE doing at the gym, which is activating my glutes (why waste time doing that at the gym) ab stuff (i am never in the mood to do abs after a heavy sesh, and i'd rather just do that shit while watching netflix)  and pull ups (i can do them split over the day instead of panting in the gym!)  make sure to get one like pictured above though - it hinges against the doorframe instead of pointing all the force down. </p>

<p>Out of all 3, the pull up bar is just mad not to have considering how hard it is to train your back at home!</p>

<p>A good hard, flat foam roller and a peanut ball is awesome to just have at home as well if you don't, same price range! Not only is it cheap/free massage, it has helped my posture throughout the years immensly. I used to walk around like a sloth in my teen years. </p>

<p>In case of rich friends, I love my powerblocks (adjustable dumbbells) -they come with a "basic" size that you upgrade them as you go instead of buying 1 ton of iron to start with. </p>
<p>I also have a cheap adjustable bench which cost me a whopping 35 bucks and has lasted me three years. Can do so much with one if it declines and inclines!</p>


<h2>Lifting Friends:</h2>

<p>Ooh, I can help with this! Carrying a "dumb" weight is a common physical endurance test included in a lot of entrance exams. </p>
<p>You're best spending nearly all of your time going to quad training, with some added emphasis on keeping your core stable (so training a standalone valsalva maneuver).</p>

<p>This makes it hard to do outside of the gym of course, but there's a pretty cheap solution if you can swing it. Sandbags! They're pretty cheap to buy in kits, and possibly even cheaper to DIY.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Nl6CYG5zgc">Sandbag front squatting </a>
is the A to Z in learning to carry dumb weights, because not only are you training the absolute shit out of your quads with all that uneven weight shifted onto your frontal plane - you also have to perform <a href="https://youtu.be/eMJ4g9eQ5vs?t=15">a bear hug carry to get into position</a></p> 
<p>Free skill practice! And picking people up is very much skill and not much about weight.. </p>

<p>unless of course you also want to bench your frens. </p>


<h2>On developing a gynoid bodyshape:</h2>

<p>The pull up bar is excellent for hanging leg raises. Lower ab "V" definition  is the most frequent aesthetic desired by people aspiring to look more feminine. I would avoid training your obliques to not add bulk to your midsection.</p>

<p>Your main focus might be developing your glutes - in particular your gluteus medius muscles to add the "upper buttock rounding" that visually adds to hip size. (1)</p>
<p>and your hamstrings to add the "fullness" that android bodyshapes often lack in their thighs. (2)</p>
<p>Squats are popular because they'll hit everything in your posterior chain, but I like them more as a "burn out" exercise rather than the main one because a jack of all trades is a master of none.</p>

<p>With this in mind I'd start off the major exercises in whatever routine you might come up with hip thrusts or glute bridges, followed with hip abductions and rounding out with leg curls or romanian deadlift dumbell variations with whatever weights you can find at home. </p>
<p>Abs are small, resilient muscles - work them independent of your training.</p>


<h2>On developing a transmasc shape:</h2>

<p>Space turtle hit on some great marks already, especially on drawing attention to specific features for a "visual" change of a gynoid to an android body shape, but I'd like to add some extra detail. </p>

<p>@[redacted] You really needn't worry about adding "hip" size vs "glute size" disproportionately as long as you're not focusing on isolating your gluteus medius (1). A well developed medius is what contributes to a hourglass figure since it rounds out the entire upper buttock and pushed out the natural fat dips in the hips. </p>
<p>Don't do specific hip abduction work and you're gucci. </p>

<p>I'd also like to talk about "thighs" -  there are some differences in musculature there. I'm of the opinion that every trainee should have well developed thighs just because of the added health in the posterior chain, but if you were also to add some quadriceps-specific isolation training (2) , this would really help to "accentuate" the muscles in your legs, giving you that X frame appearance that typically marks an android bodytype. </p>

<p>I'll end this with answering your original question: The advice I repeat weekly to transfemme and ciswomen that explicitely do not want to appear bulky is to avoid training the obliques, because they respond quickly and will give you a blocky-ish appearance that minimizes the visual appeal of a curvy body since it directly increases the circumference of the waist. </p> 
<p>For you? Obliques should be trained every day in some way - and you'll have your strong trunk core in no time. </p>


<h2>Beginner's Routine:</h2>

<p>you can fight your anxiety and go "hey parentals, i'm into fitness which is in your best interest, donate 10 bucks for a pull up bar" that will be immensly useful. </p>

<p>if you have to stay confined inside in your home you can still perform most of the basics of a 3x weekly bodyweight program. Pick exercises for back/chest/core and lower body. </p>
<p>Do them using sets and reps, say 3x15 to get the best bang for your buck. Mon/wed/fri for some rest inbetween, add sets or do harder variations to progress. </p>

<p>An example for monday with no other equipment than a sofa could be: </p>

<ul>
<li>Warmup to break a sweat </li>
<li>Push ups, (chest) </li>
<li>Table rows (back)</li>
<li>Couch dips (triceps)</li>
<li>Couch split squats (legs)</li>
<li>Couch hip thrusts (glutes)</li>
<li>Bicycle crunches (core) </li>
</ul>

<p>This shouldn’t take more than 20 minutes with plenty rest between sets,  and you can pick whatever exercises you like for your muscle groups. </p>

<p>Your dumbells are on the light side, but you can probably perform lateral raises with them - which I think everyone looking for a masculine frame should be doing every day. </p>


<h2>Adding Calories:</h2>

<p>Hey, I except for nuts I noticed your examples of food aren't very energy dense. They're more of the filling kind. </p>
<p>In your case, you really don't have to think about "nutrients" and healthy - not right now. It's okay to eat the basic protein blocks for life and then fill up on easily consumed calories - your favourite snack? </p>

<p>Have you tried drinking your calories? Most people find that way easier, which is why gainers and protein powders come in shake form. Finding a gainer with a taste you find really paletable might be an easy way out. Chocolate milkshake gainers are popular ways to get about 800-1000 kcal in without really noticing.(edited)</p>

<p>There's a slippery slope here easily documented from surgeries or hospitilzation, that when you restrict food intake and the actual processing your gastric system has to do your stomach chamber walls will contract and shrink for better efficiency. To break this cycle without help from a dietist you're going to have to eat more, one way or another. </p>

<p>One difficulty spike might be that you're trying to force yourself to eat larger portions when lunch/dinner/breakfast is served. That's not the best way to go about this, because just like any muscle you can train yourself to eat more by spreading out the workload. This is much more prominent after times when you've cut portion sizes (subconciously or otherwise)</p>

<p>For example, when I first start bulking after going through a shredding cycle, I set alarms every 3 hours i'm awake and when that alarm rings, that's when I eat. I don't particularly enjoy it to begin with, but it's what it takes for a week or two until my neuroplasticity settles and I get used to eating larger portions when I do eat normally instead. </p>

<p>This is also the system used for people with restriction compulsion, because it works very well. You'd get help setting this up as a first step if your doctor has to escalate you, there's little to no medicine to help here other than the hard work of eating as much as you need.  Most importantly, don't feel like this is hopeless or an invalid reason to seek help when or if you need it. Bodies are complex! It's really cool that you're taking steps and are trying to get ahead of it.</p>


<h2>Progressions:</h2>

<p>The benefit of going to a gym is that you can microload. IE, instead of push ups with your entire bodyweight you can start with bench pressing close to nothing, and adding weights in tiny increments as your system gets used to the work.</p>

<p>If you're unable to utilize a gym however, remember that you can't replace one workout with another for the same effect. I see "oh, just do jumping jacks, or ab crunches until you're fit enough for x" and that's clearly not going to work. </p>
<p>If you really want to do push ups, you can start with easier variations. </p>

<p>You may not to be able to do a single push up, but can you do some on your knees? Eventually, doing enough of those (making sure to only push with your chest of course) should net you a few normal good form push ups.</p>

<p>Same goes in the example of pull ups - you might not be able to do one, but you can probably lower yourself from a bar a couple of times until you could maybe do one. Finding variations of the stuff you want to but can't do is normally just "x variation" "or x progression" :slight_smile:</p>

<p>Progression is the name of the game for all exercise, start easy. KEEP TRACK of your sets and repetitions. Repeat them and add difficulty in workout to workout or weekly, without difficulty change - your muscles won't grow. </p>

<p>You probably also know you need a decent amount of protein to actually build some of the muscles you're damaging during exercise, but I'm adding it for the lurkers.</p>


<h2>Lateral Raises (shoulders):</h2>

<p>May I introduce you to my lord and savior, the lateral raise?</p>

<p>I love lateral raises, it's an amazing exercise you can do .. with low weights! you can even do them at home! for your mid deltoids to oumph your shoulders out.</p>
<p>It's a small muscle that recovers quickly, if you're not otherwise stressing your shoulders (benching, over head work etc) you could focus on them every other day if you so wanted</p>

<h2>Masculine Back/upper body:</h2>

<p>Focusing a lot on pulling movements with about half that in pushing volume.</p>
<p>(maybe sneak in a 20 dollar pull up bar for your next birthday?) </p>
<p>LATS, middle and rear deltoids, traps and obliques will easily start to distinguish a masculine frame from a feminine base in half a year - provided you eat accordingly!</p>

<p>Training lats is key for getting a wider back which hides your hip figure, but hard to do without said pull up bar. Red and orange is middle and rear delts to build up your shoulders, and green for traps. These I'd say are essential, if we're leaving out the lower body.</p>

<h2>Small Waist</h2>

<p>Fat is random, muscle is deliberate. For a thinner waist you'll have to lower your bodyfat until reasonable, then build up the rest of the body to make the waist look smaller. Wider hips for example like you're already going for. I would avoid training obliques like [redacted] is doing if you're looking for a slimmer waist, you can do other ab work if a stronger core is what you're looking for. </p>

<p>For your building needs - go hamstrings for upper thigh width, glutes and specifically the glutues medius muscles for "rounder" more gynoid looking buttocks. </p>
<p>All of these are best done in a gym, which is a wonderful place to be.  </p>
<p>Your bread and butter in order of importance should be hip thrusts, hip abduction, hamstring curls and squats.</p>


<h2>On Abs:</h2>

<p>Every cut cycle I do i go from goldfish bowl to visible abs. </p>

<p>With a gynoid body I could never achive it unless i reached less than 18% bodyfat, and now with an android composition it's more like less than 13%</p>
<p>It's impossible to maintain year round if you also want to not be a stick figure,  so I try to focus my cuts in time for summer periods where i'll have my shirt off more often. :woman_shrugging: </p>
<p>90% of the work will be to maintain low enough bodyfat. But since getting rid of fat isn't a full time job you should fill the other checkboxes as well at the same time:</p>
 
<p>Stomach vacuums! </p>
<p>And.. </p>
<p>If you're currently untrained, doing ab work will help limit the barrier a little and add definition. The abs are really small in comparison to your body, so you can train daily if you want. Don't fall for the 100-whatevers-a-day-apps. </p>
<p>Be smart about your training and use sets and reps and added resistance to train efficient.</p>

<p>It's strange how well it works, but it's been a body builder staple for years because its a really good way to train the transverse abodminals to ahem, "hold all the crap tight." An overall flatter stomach is part of the uphill battle.</p>

<p>Make sure you're training higher and lower abdominals equally, or you'll end up with a 2-pack. The real key to ab work isn't different from all other training, the only way to stimulate growth is to use progressive overload, aka, keep making it harder for yourself. I use extra weight like cable machines or dumbells between my legs  but if you're working at home you can just add more sets and do harder variations.</p>

<p>I run this at the end of my leg days, thrice a week. I avoid doing oblique work like twisting motions or bicycle crunches or "russians" because aesthetically i don't want a wider midsection.</p>
<ul>
<li>2x6-10 weighted lying crunches</li>
<li>3x12-15 hanging leg raises</li>
<li>3x12-15 rope machine crunches</li>
<li>weighted planks 2x30s</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you're "pulling with your stomach" or crunching in your abs rather than raising your hips. It's very easy to cheat when not under a bar so be honest to yourself and be consistent.</p>

<h2>Lower Back:</h2>

<p>Any hip hinge movement is going to be your best bet! Deadlifts, squats and good mornings are going to be some primary movers there. </p>

<p>I've been getting really into 45* back extensions with a barbell to really streeeetch my lower back, feels amazing to finish off like that on lower body day. </p>

<p>Pull ups aren't doing much for your spinal erectors unfortunately</p>

<h2>Fencing</h2>

<p>yoo [redacted], if you want burst you should look into hiit rather than long cardio sessions to improve your vo2max efficiently. That's nothing you should do every day though, even if you have the time. </p>

<p>If you have access to a bike of any kind that'll be easier on your joints to minimize recovery issues for sport specific training.</p>

<p>as for strength -  do you have access to a gym?</p>

<p>Do you have access to barbells or dumbells? </p>
<p>I believe a lot of force and movement comes out of the hip and quads in fencing, so just general leg and glute strenght to help you stay with bent knees and open hips is probably a great bet. Hip thrusts, leg extensions and squat for example. </p>

<p>As a replacement for lacking barbells could be dumbell goblin squats, or using cables for glute kickbacks. </p>

<p>Over that, making sure the subscapular muscles (the tiny things holding your shoulder in the socket!) can handle the stress with shoulder exercises like the dumbell shoulder press, facepulls and lateral raises to hit all 3 heads of the deltoid equally. </p>
<p>This, combined with ab work should do the minumum of "athleticism" as the base of your sport.</p>


<h2>Body Sculpting Philosophy</h2>

<p>By diet it's really up to if you want to gain or lose overall size, and the answer is always going to be eat more or eat less. There are different ways of doing this, but it's always majorly going to be about a caloric defecit or surplus. </p>

<p>There's a lot of talk about avoiding muscle but I don't think thats helpful as a blanket statement either, neither is gaining fat since you need luck, genetics and hormones to decide where that fat is located. </p>

<p>Try to identify what you mean by "feminine shape" </p>
<p>Do you want wider hips relative to your midsection,  do you want a more pronounced collar, a bigger booty? Do you want to be just slender all over or are there things you can do to improve your posture to present the way you want? </p>

<p>By knowing key areas you'd like to change on your body you can work towards that goal instead of trying a shotgun solution to everything and hoping for the best. It'll be faster, it'll be healthier, and it'll give you better results in the long run. It just takes a bit of work. If you can get yourself into a gym that's going to be the best solution for any kind of body sculpting.</p>


<h2>Root Beer Protien Fluff</h2>
<p>General recipe is casein powder, frozen berries for texture and ice cream properties, and some liquid. Liquid in the US tends to mean root beer, so there ya go. The fluff is mostly air, so it fills up you up quickly while being mostly protein nutritionally. Fun stuff.</p>


<h2>On Cutting for a diet</h2>
<p>Eat!* If you're on a caloric budget and if you know you're prone to overeating, find something you can snack on with small consequenses!</p>

<p>I tend to crave food 24/7 when i'm the first week into a cut, so I fill my fridge with volyme, not quality. </p>
<p>Sweetener-made frozen cheesecakes, copius amounts of frozen berries, and straight up heads of lettuce. Your poops will be marvelous, but that's the price you pay to cut.</p>
